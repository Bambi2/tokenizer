# How to use G42?

### 1) Get a wallet
To start exchanging G42 token, you first need to create a wallet. 
It can be just a private key that you create yourself programmatically, for example. 
However, you can also use existing ready-to-use wallets, like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) or the one you like.
In this doc I'll provide examples using MetaMask wallet as it just requires to have a browser for its use.

### 2) Import Holesky blockchain into the wallet
There are different blockchains that exist in this world and every blockchain has its own tokens.
G42 currently supports only Holesky blockchain because it is free and doesn't require any money to deploy tokens to it.
By default, MetaMask doesn't show any assets on Holesky blockchain. To do that, you need to import it by yourself:
1. Go to [Chainlist](https://chainid.network/)
2. Connect your wallet by clicking **_Connect Wallet_** in top right
3. When successful, type "holesky" in the search bar on top or just head by the link: https://chainid.network/chain/17000
4. After finding the chain, click the **_Add Chain_** button
5. Approve all the needed actions
6. Now you should be able to see your balance on the Holesky chain!

### 3) Import contract of G42 token to start utilizing it
After importing holesky chain you probably see only Ethereum tokens balance on MetaMask.
To see G42 balance, click **_Import_** button on the wallet and add the address of G42 contract.
The main address of G42 on Holesky chain is `0xaB2861E0BaB91f2003b6176eD028aef3663151F2`.
Now you should the G42 tokens balance on the wallet!

### 4) Spend! 
Well, now you got everything in your hands, just earn or find the tokens.
Maybe someone who has G42 tokens is ready to provide them to you for some work.
And maybe you can then spend them on something else, if anyone is ready to accept them.
